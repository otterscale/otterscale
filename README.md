**OtterScale** is a comprehensive **hyper-converged infrastructure platform** that unifies compute, storage, and networking resources into a single, scalable solution. Built for modern data centers, it seamlessly integrates virtual machine management, software-defined networking, distributed storage, container orchestration, GPU resource management, and application marketplace capabilities.

Designed to simplify complex infrastructure operations, OtterScale provides a unified control plane for managing heterogeneous workloads across bare metal, virtualized, and containerized environments. Whether you're running traditional VMs, cloud-native applications, or GPU-accelerated workloads, OtterScale delivers enterprise-grade performance with operational simplicity.
