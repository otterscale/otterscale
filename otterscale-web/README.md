### Database Setup

Before starting development, you need to set up the database schema:

```bash
pnpm migrate
```

This command will create the necessary database tables and schema required for the application.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies and set up the database, start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm dev -- --open
```
